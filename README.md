# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard---Summer-Training

📊 Pizza Sales Dashboard in Excel
This project is a comprehensive Excel dashboard created as part of my Summer Training under the guidance of Ms. Gaurika Dhingra in the Angaar Batch at Lovely Professional University (LPU). The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data and visualize key business metrics for better decision-making.

📁 Datasets Used
The dashboard is based on the following datasets:

orders.csv – Contains order ID and order date

order_details.csv – Contains order ID, pizza ID, and quantity

pizzas.csv – Contains pizza ID, pizza type, size, and price

pizza_types.csv – Contains pizza type ID, category, name, and ingredients

🧩 Data Preparation
All four datasets were imported into individual sheets in Excel.

A new sheet named MasterData was created using formulas like VLOOKUP, LEFT, SUBSTITUTE, and TEXT to combine and enhance the data.

Additional fields such as pizza_type_id, order_date, month, price, size, category, ingredients, and total_sales were derived.
